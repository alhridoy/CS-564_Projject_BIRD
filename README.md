# CS-564_Project_BIRD

This SQL code represents the creation of a database schema for a birdwatching application. It defines tables for storing information about birdwatchers, bird species, habitats, bird sightings, and conservation efforts. The schema allows users to track and record bird sightings, capture details about bird species and their attributes, and monitor the impact of climate change on bird populations. This code serves as the foundation for managing birdwatching data and facilitating analysis and conservation efforts in the birdwatching community.
